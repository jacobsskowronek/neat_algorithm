# NEAT Algorithm

This is just my interpretation and rough implementation of the NEAT algorithm from reading the following paper:
http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

The NEAT-Python implementation works better, and faster, but this was done for fun and and for my own education.
